## Jobs board API

The idea for this was to bring together multiple jobs board APIs together and make a simple user interface to show the data from each of them. Didnt have a whole lot of time because 2 other code tests came up in that timeframe.

It uses express on the backend and react on the front. I chose not to use a database for this and just relied on local storage for data persistence. If i was to spend mpre time on this i would add user auth and and of course use a database.

At first i was pulling off the data from 3 different data sets. I made 3 different kind of job lisiting components to pull the dat from each but this was messy and needed a lot more code on the front end. I refactored to map the 3 different array data sets into a uniform object of arrays before sending to the front end. This reduced a lot of clutter.
